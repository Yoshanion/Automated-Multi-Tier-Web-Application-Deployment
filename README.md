This project aims to deploy a scalable web application composed of multiple tiers (e.g., front-end, back-end, database) using containerized environments. We'll use Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration. The infrastructure on AWS (including VPC, Load Balancer, and Auto Scaling groups) will be provisioned and managed using Terraform. GitHub Actions will be utilized for continuous integration and deployment pipelines, ensuring updates and infrastructure changes are automatically deployed upon code commits.
